# DataBlitz (APPLIED MULTIPLE LINEAR REGERSSION)
Approach:-
These are some of the most common steps you will encounter with any machine learning workflow whether it be simple or complex.
1. Load the data
2.Analysing for the Dataset
3. Pre-processing data (Filling missing values etc)
4. one-hot encoding
5. Modelling
6. Finding Accuracy
7. 
#Loading the Dataset
I have Loaded the Required Dataset named as "housing.csv"

#Preprocessing
In the data set I have got the a lot of null values in total bedrooms coloumn i have changed every thing to the Mean values and replaced and balanced the data set.

#one hot encoding
In ocean_proximity i have performed  the one hot encoding beacause the values in that area the strings so i have converted to the numeric values.

#Uisng the Sklearn:-
I have performed the train test split i have given 80% for training and 20% for testing and fited the model.i have used the "MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION". And got the final accuracy as the 62.85%.
